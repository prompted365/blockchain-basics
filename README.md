## 📊 Project Overview

**UbiquityOS Security Academy** leverages perception-aware computing principles to teach blockchain security. Unlike pattern-matching training, we help users understand *why* scams work by building mental models of both legitimate and malicious behaviors.

### About UbiquityOS by Prompted LLC

[UbiquityOS](https://promptedllc.com) is the first perception-aware intelligent operating system, coordinating different perspectives rather than forcing conformity. This Security Academy applies those principles to blockchain security education:

- **Perception-Aware Learning**: Understand multiple viewpoints (user, scammer, protocol)
- **Theory of Mind in Practice**: See through social engineering by modeling attacker thinking
- **Coordinated Intelligence**: Learn from real threat intelligence, not just rules
- **Persistent Knowledge**: Build transferable security instincts, not memorized patterns

> "PRIMITIVES. PARADOX. PERCEPTIONS. PERSISTENCE. POTENTIAL." - Prompted LLC

This platform is part of the **Ubiquology** ecosystem - fusing the -ologies of our world into intelligent systems for governance and security.
